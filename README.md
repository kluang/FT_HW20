# Smart Contracts with Solidity

![smartcontract](smartcontract.gif)

Using Solidity we will create three different smart contracts.

## 1. Pay Your Associate-Level Employees Quickly and Easily

The `AssociateProfitSplitter` contract will accept Ether into the contract and divide the Ether evenly among the associate level employees. This will allow the Human Resources department to pay employees quickly and efficiently.

## 2. Distribute Profits to Different Tiers of Employees

The `TieredProfitSplitter` contract will distribute different percentages of incoming Ether to employees at different tiers/levels. For example, the CEO gets paid 60%, CTO 25%, and Bob gets 15%.

## 3. Distribute Company Shares for Employees in a "Deferred Equity Incentive Plan" Automatically

The `DeferredEquityPlan` contract models traditional company stock plans. This contract will automatically manage 1000 shares with an annual distribution of 250 over 4 years for a single employee.
